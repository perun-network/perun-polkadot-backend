This project implements a [Substrate] backend for our [go-perun] framework. 
It enables *go-perun* applications to create state-channels on [Polkadot] by connecting to the [Perun Pallet].

## Project structure
* `channel/` channel interface implementations
  * `pallet/` [Perun Pallet] specific code
* `wallet/` wallet interface implementations
  * `sr25519/` *Schnorrkel-Ristretto Ed25519* wallet
* `pkg/` 3rd-party helpers
* `client/` helper functions for setting up a *go-perun* client
* `cmd/` console commands for debugging
  * `balance_events/` logs balance changes for dev accounts
  * `system_events/` logs important system events
* `chain.json + accounts.json` configuration for testing

## Development Setup
If you want to locally develop with this project:

1. Clone the repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/perun-network/perun-polkadot-backend
cd perun-polkadot-backend
```

2. Start a local substrate chain by following the instructions in our [polkadot node] repo.

3. Run all tests:  
```sh
go test ./...
```
This can take while but should eventually finish successfully. The long testing time results from the block-time of the node, which is set to one second.

### Test debugging

The substrate CLI node does not output any events or updates to the console.  
We provide two commands to help with test debugging by logging chain events.  

Monitor balance updates for *Alice'* and *Bobs* account:
```sh
go run ./cmd/balance_events
```

Log succeeded and failed Extrinsics:
```sh
go run ./cmd/system_events
```
## Demo

We prepared a [demo CLI node] to play around with payment channels on substrate chains.  
Highly recommended you to check it out üëç
