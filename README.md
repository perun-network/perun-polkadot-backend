This project implements a [Substrate] backend for our [go-perun] framework. 
It enables *go-perun* applications to create state-channels on [Polkadot] by connecting to the [Perun Pallet].

## Project structure
* `channel/` channel interface implementations
  * `pallet/` [Perun Pallet] specific code
* `wallet/` wallet interface implementations
  * `sr25519/` *Schnorrkel-Ristretto Ed25519* wallet
* `pkg/` 3rd-party helpers
* `client/` helper functions for setting up a *go-perun* client
* `wallet/sr25519/test/accounts.json` config for testing

## Development Setup
If you want to locally develop with this project:

1. Clone the repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/perun-network/perun-polkadot-backend
cd perun-polkadot-backend
```

2. Start a local Substrate node with the Perun Pallet installed. See the [polkadot node] repository for more details.

```sh
docker run --rm -p 9944:9944 ghcr.io/perun-network/polkadot-test-node
```

3. Run the tests. This step needs a working [Go distribution](https://golang.org), see [go.mod](go.mod) for the required version.

```sh
go test -p 1 ./...
```

The tests take a while but should eventually finish successfully. The long testing time results from the block-time of the node. The `-p 1` flag is important, since the tests otherwise are started in parallel and mess up the account nonce.

## Demo

We prepared a [demo CLI node] to play around with payment channels on substrate chains.  
Highly recommended you to check it out üëç

## Funding

The development of this project is supported by the [Web3 Foundation] through the [Grants Program].
